        Learning to code is genuinely one of the best skills you can develop, no matter who you are or how old you might be. But let’s be real, there’s so much misinformation out there. Maybe you’ve come across some of these myths and thought coding just “isn’t for you.” So, let’s clear things up and talk about the five biggest myths that often stop people from even trying.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #1: "You have to be a math genius"</h2>
    <p>
        This is probably the myth I hear most often, and honestly, it couldn’t be further from the truth. Sure, coding uses logic and problem-solving, but in reality, you rarely need anything beyond the basics of math. What really matters is being curious, patient, and willing to learn from your mistakes.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #2: "It's too late to start learning"</h2>
    <p>
        People love to say you have to start young, but the truth is, age is just a number. I’ve seen people switch to tech careers in their 30s, 40s, or even later. Maybe you’re a student, maybe you’re considering a career change, or maybe you just want a new hobby. Whatever the case, there’s no such thing as being “too late” for coding. Your motivation is what really counts.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #3: "You need a Computer Science degree"</h2>
    <p>
        Don’t get me wrong, a degree can help, but it’s far from necessary. Most employers these days care much more about your skills and what you’ve actually built than what your diploma says. There are so many amazing self-taught developers out there who learned from YouTube, online courses, and by building their own projects. Show what you can do, that’s what matters.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #4: "If you get stuck, you're not cut out for coding"</h2>
    <p>
        Getting stuck happens to everyone. Seriously every developer, no matter how experienced, runs into roadblocks all the time. The important thing is to know how to look for answers, ask for help, and keep pushing forward. Coding isn’t about always knowing the answer. It’s about not giving up when you don’t.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth #5: "You need perfect English to learn programming"</h2>
    <p>
        Most programming documentation is in English, but you definitely don’t need to be fluent to start coding. There are plenty of resources in other languages, and if you get stuck, Google Translate is your friend. Plus, the more you code, the more comfortable you’ll get with tech vocabulary anyway.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Don’t let these myths hold you back. Coding truly is for everyone. No matter your background, age, or education. If you have curiosity and you’re willing to stick with it, you’re already on the right track. Been thinking about learning to code? Consider this your sign to finally give it a go.<br>
